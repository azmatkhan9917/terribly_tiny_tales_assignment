<h2>Terribly Tiny Tales Assignment</h2>
This project is a React.js application developed for the Terribly Tiny Tales assignment. It is currently live and hosted on Vercel at https://terribly-tiny-tales-assignment-roan.vercel.app/.

<h3>Components</h3>

<h4>1. App Component</h4>
The app component is the main component that orchestrates the application.
Usage: Renders Navbar, Profile, LogoComponent, and multiple BlogComponent instances.

<h4>2. Profile Component</h4>
The Profile component renders the user profile screen. It includes a banner, a circular user image overlapping the banner, the user's username, follower and following buttons, and a link to the user's LinkedIn profile.

<h4>3. Navbar Component</h4>
The Navbar component represents the navigation bar at the top of the application. It includes a black background with a circular logo image, a vertical rule, and the text "STORIES" in bold. On the right side, there is a button labeled "Courses."

<h4>4. Logo Component</h4>
The LogoComponent displays statistics and information in a responsive circular layout. It includes SVG icons for a star, thumbs up, eye, and heart, along with corresponding numeric values. The second line shows the total number of posts in bold blue.

<h4>5. Blog Component</h4>
The BlogComponent is responsible for displaying individual blog posts. It includes a title, content, author information, date, read time, and the number of views. The thumbs-up icon is also displayed, replacing the count with a circular boundary.

<h4>6. CSS Flexibility and Media Queries</h4>
The CSS files, such as Profile.css, Navbar.css, LogoComponent.css, and BlogComponent.css, utilize flexible containers and the @media property to ensure a consistent rendering experience across various mobile devices. This responsiveness enhances the user experience by adapting the layout to different screen sizes.
